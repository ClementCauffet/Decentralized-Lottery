# Lottery Project by Clement Cauffet

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

The main idea is tu use smart-contract to create a lottery without a 3rd trusted party.

Further development will implement graphical aspects, but not interested in working on this at the moment.

## Installation:

```
cd akiltour
npm i
```

## Running hardat and deploy

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
